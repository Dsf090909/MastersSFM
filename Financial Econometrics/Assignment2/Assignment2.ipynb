    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is to select one stock out of the constituents, and analyse the time-varying correlation of its daily return with the Dow Jones index daily returns, based on a DCC model and a BEKK model. Create the daily logreturns of the stock you selected (`y1`), and create the Dow Jones daily logreturns (`y2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As a first step in building a DCC model, select and estimate suitable (univariate) GARCH models for `y1` and `y2`. That is, choose a specification for the conditional mean and conditional variance, estimate and test it, and extend the specification if necessary. <br>\n",
    "    Report the estimated final models, and some misspecification test to indicate the quality of the models. Avoid printing entire tables of correlograms and $Q$-statistics; only a few statistics with $p$-values, for a number of different lag lengths, will suffice. <br>\n",
    "    Next, construct the variance series and standardized residuals from the two models. Also, construct the conditional standard deviations (=volatilities) as the square roots of the variance series (`s1` and `s2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Estimate the DCC model using R's `rmgarch` package. Check whether the estimates of the DCC parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are positive; if not, try different starting values or numerical optimization settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Estimate a BEKK model using R's `mgarchBEKK` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compare the volatilities and correlations (`rho`) of the two methods in line graphs. Do the two methods produce comparable outcomes? What are the main differences?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now test the adequacy of the two correlation estimates `rho_dcc` and `rho_bekk` (together with the corresponding volatility\n",
    "estimates), in two different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Construct a test as indicated under equation (39) in Engle (2002). That is, construct the standardised errors `z1 = y1/s1` and `z2 = (y2/s2 - rho*y1/s1)/np.sqrt(1-rho^2)`, and run a regression of the square of `z2` on lagged squares and cross-products of `z1` and `z2`. Report the result of an $F$-test for the hypothesis that all coefficients in this regression are zero, for the two different choices of (`s1`, `s2`, `rho`). Which of the two alternative correlation models performs best in this test?\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Construct a test as indicated under equations (40)$-$(41) in Engle (2002). That is, construct the 5% Value at Risk series for an equal-weighted portfolio ($w=\\frac{1}{2}$) from the volatilities and correlations, calculate the corresponding hit series, and run a regression of this hit on a constant, its own lags and the current VaR. Report again the result of an $F$-test that all coefficients are zero, for the two different methods. Which procedure performs best now?"
